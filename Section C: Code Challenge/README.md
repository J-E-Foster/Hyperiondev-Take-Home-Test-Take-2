<h1>Section C: Code Challenge</h1>

## Option 1: Say the Number

**This solution defines an algorithm to convert any positive or negative integer - up to +-999.999.999.999,999 (i.e. +-999 trillion) into English text, complete with punctuation (commas, hyphens, & full stops)**.

* The solution was implemented using Java.
* A test class was included for the main algorithm method.
* For an in-depth explanation of the code, see the [source code](https://github.com/J-E-Foster/Hyperiondev-Take-Home-Test/blob/master/Section%20C:%20Code%20Challenge/src/numberSayer/NumberSayer.java).
* For references, please see the [source code](https://github.com/J-E-Foster/Hyperiondev-Take-Home-Test/blob/master/Section%20C:%20Code%20Challenge/src/numberSayer/NumberSayer.java).
